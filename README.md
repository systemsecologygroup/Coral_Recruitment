# Coral_Recruitment

Matlab code files related to the paper 'Impacts of different density-dependent recruitments on coral reef recovery'

# Description of files

The provided code will help to generate the time series at different alpha (exponent of local recruitment).

# How to run the model

Running the model requires two scripts in the 'Github_Coral_Recruitment' folder, the 'main_time_series.m' and the 'coral.m'. The first script is for decribing the parameters and running the code, while the second script contains the system of equations.
